1. New model, max_perf, none of the solver says it's feasible.
2. New model, min_area, BARON works for small PerfLB.
3. Old model, max_perf, only couenne claims to provide "optimal" solution. 
   BARON will run until CPU time limit reached, then it will provide an intermediate
   soln that is actually better than what couenne claimed to be optimal (weird).

# Saptadeep meeting notes
1. Write a paper documenting the model. Identify equations or variables that might be redundant.
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratically_constrained_quadratic_program
3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming_relaxation
4. 5% increase in freq -> 10% increase in core area but only 1% increase in L1/L2 area.
   component_areas[''] will have l1, l2, and core parameters but 
   component_count[''] will be the same for all three
   Power for l1, l2, and core maybe can just be divided from the current number for core?
5. For BARON, find out a way to modify CPU time limit.
6. It is possible that as the model asks for more performance
   (whether through maximizing performance or through a higher PerfLB), 
   the search space becomes intractable for the solver.
