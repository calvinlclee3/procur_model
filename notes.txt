1. New model, max_perf, none of the solver says it's feasible.
2. New model, min_area, BARON works for small PerfLB.
3. Old model, max_perf, only couenne claims to provide "optimal" solution. 
   BARON will run until CPU time limit reached, then it will provide an intermediate
   soln that is actually better than what couenne claimed to be optimal (weird).
