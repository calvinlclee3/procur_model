1. New model, max_perf, none of the solver says it's feasible.
2. New model, min_area, BARON works for small PerfLB.
3. Old model, max_perf, only couenne claims to provide "optimal" solution. 
   BARON will run until CPU time limit reached, then it will provide an intermediate
   soln that is actually better than what couenne claimed to be optimal (weird).

# Saptadeep meeting notes
1. Write a paper documenting the model. Identify equations or variables that might be redundant.
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratically_constrained_quadratic_program
3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming_relaxation
6. It is possible that as the model asks for more performance
   (whether through max_perf objective or through a higher PerfLB in min_area), 
   the search space becomes intractable for the solver.
